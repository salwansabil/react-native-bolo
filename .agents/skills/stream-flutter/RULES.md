# Stream Flutter - non-negotiable rules

Every rule below is stated once. Other files reference this file - do not duplicate these rules inline.

---

## Secrets and auth

Never hardcode a Stream API secret in app code, `pubspec.yaml`, or chat. The client may hold the **API key** and a **user token**; the **API secret** stays server-side only.

Default token model:

- Use a backend-issued token when the user already has a backend.
- Use a CLI-generated token (`getstream token <user_id>` or `getstream token <user_id> --ttl <duration>`) for local dev and demo flows - this is the preferred path when no backend exists.
- Use a static token only when the user explicitly wants to paste one themselves.
- Never invent or generate fake production credentials.
- The API secret never leaves the CLI/server side; only the API key and the generated token go into app code.

---

## Surface permission prerequisites proactively (Chat)

Permissions are checked on **client-side calls only**; server-side calls (CLI / backend with the secret) bypass them. So seeding works while the same action 403s from the app. **Whenever the app does more than chat inside channels the user already belongs to — discovering channels, self-joining, or signing in as a guest — name the required channel-type grant in the same turn you build the feature**, before any runtime error. Most commonly: `Read Channel` (`ReadChannel`) to browse non-member channels, `Add Own Channel Membership` (`AddOwnChannelMembership`) to self-join; `guest` is stricter than `user` and needs the grants too. Detail and exact error strings: [`references/CHAT-FLUTTER.md`](references/CHAT-FLUTTER.md) → Channel permissions & roles; the proactive prompt lives in [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) Step 0.5 → Permissions awareness. This is a heads-up, not a blocker — build the feature, but never let discover/join/guest flows fail silently on first run.

---

## No wrapper or bridge abstractions

Do **not** introduce intermediate types - `ChatManager`, `VideoCallBridge`, `StreamWrapper`, `SDKAdapter`, `FeedsService`, or similar - between the app and the Stream SDK.

Use SDK types directly:

- `StreamChatClient` initialized once before `runApp`
- `StreamChat` widget wrapping the app's widget tree
- `StreamChannel` inherited widget for per-screen channel context
- `StreamChannelListController` stored as a field on a `State` object
- `StreamVideo` initialized once before `runApp`; accessed via `StreamVideo.instance`
- `Call` objects retrieved via `StreamVideo.instance.makeCall(...)` and used directly
- `StreamFeedClient` initialized once before `runApp`; `FlatFeed` / `NotificationFeed` references obtained from `client.flatFeed(...)` / `client.notificationFeed(...)`
- `FeedBloc` wrapped in `FeedProvider` and accessed via `FeedProvider.of(context).bloc`

The only exception is a thin service class to isolate initialization when the app uses multiple Stream products.

---

## Project ownership

Preserve the app's existing architecture:

- Do **not** convert existing navigation patterns (GoRouter, auto_route, Navigator) unless the user asks.
- Do **not** replace existing state management (Provider, Riverpod, Bloc) unless the user asks.
- Do **not** flatten existing widget trees just to fit a sample pattern.

If there is **no Flutter project**:

- When the user **explicitly asks to create/build a new app** (Track A — e.g. "create a Flutter app that…"), scaffold it yourself: `flutter create --org <reverse.domain> --project-name <name> --platforms android,ios <dir>`. Creating the project _is_ the request — don't bounce it back. An empty, pre-named directory (e.g. `ringing/`) is a strong signal of where it should go.
- Otherwise (the user wants integration/setup but no app exists yet), do **not** scaffold silently. Tell them to run `flutter create my_app` first, then continue.

---

## Client lifetime

Initialize Stream SDK clients once, before `runApp`. Never create them:

- inside a `build` method
- in a `StatelessWidget` body
- in a computed getter that re-runs on rebuild

**Chat:** `StreamChatClient` initialized once before `runApp`. `StreamChat` must appear in the widget tree before any Stream Chat widget renders - typically as a `builder` wrapper around `MaterialApp`. If the user switches accounts, call `await client.disconnectUser()` before connecting the next one.

**Video:** `StreamVideo(...)` initialized once before `runApp`. It registers a singleton - access it anywhere with `StreamVideo.instance`. Accessing `StreamVideo.instance` before construction throws a `StateError`. If the user switches accounts, tear the singleton down with `await StreamVideo.reset(disconnect: true)` **before** constructing a new `StreamVideo(...)` - the constructor throws `failIfSingletonExists` otherwise. See [`references/VIDEO-FLUTTER.md`](references/VIDEO-FLUTTER.md) -> Switching users / resetting the client.

**Feeds:** `StreamFeedClient('apiKey')` initialized once before `runApp`. Call `await client.setUser(user, token)` before any feed operation. Wrap the widget tree with `FeedProvider(bloc: FeedBloc(client: client), child: ...)` when using `stream_feed_flutter_core`. Cancel all feed subscriptions in `dispose()`.

---

## UI and concurrency

Stream SDK callbacks and `async` methods return on the main isolate by default - do not `compute()` or `Isolate.spawn()` Stream work unless it is confirmed CPU-bound.

Prefer `StreamBuilder` and `ValueListenableBuilder` for reactive UI over manual `setState` + stream subscription management. Always cancel stream subscriptions in `dispose()`.

---

## Feeds UI — no pre-built components

The Stream Feeds SDK (`stream_feed`, `stream_feed_flutter_core`) ships **no UI widgets**. Every feed screen, activity card, like button, and follow button must be built with standard Flutter widgets.

- Default to Twitter-style UI. Build it immediately without asking — do not pause to confirm the style.
- Only deviate from Twitter-style when the user explicitly states a different preference (e.g., "Instagram grid", "Reddit-style votes", "photo-first").
- The UI style only affects widget composition — the SDK calls (activities, reactions, follow/unfollow) are the same regardless of style.

---

## Reference discipline

Load only the product/package reference files that match the request.

- `CHAT-FLUTTER.md` + `CHAT-FLUTTER-blueprints.md` for Chat with pre-built UI (`stream_chat_flutter`)
- `CHAT-CORE.md` + `CHAT-CORE-blueprints.md` for Chat with custom UI (`stream_chat_flutter_core`)
- `CHAT-ADVANCED-FLUTTER.md` + `CHAT-ADVANCED-FLUTTER-blueprints.md` for advanced Chat concerns — push notifications, offline/local persistence, connection lifecycle & backgrounding (both UI tiers)
- `VIDEO-FLUTTER.md` + `VIDEO-FLUTTER-blueprints.md` for Video calling (`stream_video_flutter`)
- `LIVESTREAM-FLUTTER.md` + `LIVESTREAM-FLUTTER-blueprints.md` for Livestreaming (host/viewer flows, backstage, HLS)
- `VIDEO-ADVANCED-FLUTTER.md` + `VIDEO-ADVANCED-FLUTTER-blueprints.md` for advanced Video use cases (audio rooms, multicall, chat+video, livestream feed, querying/events/preferences/moderation)
- `RINGING-FLUTTER.md` + `RINGING-FLUTTER-blueprints.md` for ringing / incoming calls with push (CallKit on iOS, FCM on Android, foreground/background/terminated handling)
- `FEEDS-FLUTTER.md` + `FEEDS-FLUTTER-blueprints.md` for Activity Feeds (`stream_feed` / `stream_feed_flutter_core`)

Do not invent missing API details. If a requested pattern is not bundled yet, say so plainly and fall back to guidance from [`sdk.md`](sdk.md) or live docs only when the user wants that.
